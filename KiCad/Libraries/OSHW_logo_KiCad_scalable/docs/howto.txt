How to make your own:
---------------------

Watch / read this first:

The last two videos should be helpful for how to create a custom .emp file from images.

If you use linux (which you should), you don't have to use the online-scaler. Just use the scripts!


---


* Create a folder to hold your new footprint library.
* Copy the scripts 'make_lib.sh' and 'scale.pl' into that folder.
* Make sure these files are executable (chmod u+x ...).
* Copy your custom .emp file into that foler.

* Run the 'make_lib.sh' script as follows:

./make_lib.sh input-file.emp lib-name.mod START END


START and END are placeholders for positive integer numbers (1,2,3...) that determine
the range of created footprint sizes. The units are metric (mm).

The 'lib-name.mod' file will show up in the 'lib' sub-folder. Add it to your pcbnew
library settings as usual.

Footprints that are created for back-layers are automagically mirrored horizontally.
To place them onto a back-layer, hover the mouse-pointer over them and press 'f' for 'flip'.
